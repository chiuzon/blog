## Hello
Recently I had the chance of using VueJS for a decentralized app. I want to say that I have some experience with React and Svelte but not with Vue, I was like a baby in a new world. The only reason I used Vue is that you can just drop the script tag inside a html file and you are kinda done.

Here is what I found using vue and ethers.js.

```js
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

const D = () => {
    //
}
```
